# SilentScalper
### *Silent Scalper - Project Summary*   

#### *Problem Statement*  
Companies dealing with cloud data face two major challenges:  
⿡ *Wasted money on idle servers* – Paying for compute even when no data is processed.  
⿢ *Crashes during traffic spikes* – Lack of auto-scaling leads to system failure.  

#### *Solution: Serverless Data Processing Pipeline*  
*Silent Scalper* eliminates idle costs and ensures scalability by leveraging AWS *serverless architecture*.

### *Architecture & Workflow*  

⿡ *Amazon S3 (Entry Point)*  
   - Files land in S3 and *automatically trigger AWS Lambda*.  

⿢ *AWS Lambda (Data Processing)*  
   - Processes files (e.g., filtering, format conversion).  
   - Moves *successful* data to *DynamoDB*.  
   - Sends *failed/corrupt* files to *a quarantine S3 bucket*.  

⿣ *DynamoDB (Storage)*  
   - Stores processed data for *instant scalability & retrieval*.  

⿤ *S3 Quarantine Bucket (Fault Isolation)*  
   - Prevents bad data from breaking the system.  

⿥ *CloudWatch (Monitoring & Logs)*  
   - Tracks processing time, error rates, and performance metrics.  

⿦ *SNS (Alerts & Notifications)*  
   - Sends notifications when errors spike or processing slows down.  

⿧ *API Gateway (External Access)*  
   - Provides a *secure interface* for external apps to submit files.  
   - Handles *authentication via API Keys & IAM roles*.  

---

### *Real-World Use Case*  
A *Medical Imaging Company* needs to process *scan reports & patient records* securely.  
- They *upload data via API Gateway* without accessing AWS directly.  
- Silent Scalper *processes, stores, and monitors the data* efficiently.  

---

### *Key Benefits*  
 *Cost-Effective* – No idle server costs, pay only for usage.  
 *Auto-Scaling* – Handles sudden traffic spikes without crashing.  
 *Fault-Tolerant* – Corrupt files go to quarantine, preventing failures.  
 *Secure & Monitored* – IAM roles, API keys, CloudWatch & SNS ensure security and visibility.  

---

### *Final Status:  Completed!*  
Silent Scalper is now a *fully functional, serverless data pipeline* that is cost-efficient, scalable, and secure.
